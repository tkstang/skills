# Implementation: first-party-standalone-installer

**Started:** 2026-09-16
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-16

> This document is used to resume interrupted implementation sessions.
>
> Conventions:
>
> - `oat_current_task_id` always points at the **next plan task to do** (not the last completed task).
> - When all plan tasks are complete, set `oat_current_task_id: null`.
> - Reviews are **not** plan tasks. Track review status in `plan.md` under `## Reviews` (e.g., `| final | code | passed | ... |`).
> - Keep phase/task statuses consistent with the Progress Overview table so restarts resume correctly.
> - Before running the `oat-project-pr-final` skill, ensure `## Final Summary (for PR/docs)` is filled with what was actually implemented.

## Progress Overview

| Phase   | Status      | Tasks | Completed |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | --------- |

## Phase 1: {Phase Name}

**Status:** in_progress
**Started:** 2026-09-16

### Phase Summary (fill when phase is complete)

## Orchestration Runs

_Each run from `oat-project-implement` appends an entry below with:_
_- Run header (number, timestamp, branch, tier, policy, phase counts)_
_- Phase Outcomes table_
_- Parallel Groups list_
_- Outstanding Items_

<!-- orchestration-runs-start -->

_Orchestration runs from `oat-project-implement` are appended here, most-recent-first within the file but append-only at the bottom of the log._

## Review Received: plan artifact gate

**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Review artifact:** `reviews/archived/artifact-plan-review-2026-09-16T231057Z.md`

**Findings:**

- Critical: 0
- Important: 1
- Medium: 3
- Minor: 4

**Disposition:** No implementation tasks were created because this was an artifact review. All findings were resolved directly in `discovery.md`, `design.md`, and `plan.md`:

- `I1` (`resolve_in_artifact`): declared the opt-in, bounded real-process test seam and its inert-by-default proof.
- `M1` (`resolve_in_artifact`): selected the planned `v0.1.2` pin with an explicit unreleased/current-payload caveat.
- `M2` (`resolve_in_artifact`): added streamed/isolated-script refusal behavior and a no-mutation test.
- `M3` (`resolve_in_artifact`): finalized `oat_template: false`.
- `m1` (`resolve_in_artifact`): enumerated unknown, duplicate, partial, and missing-value flag tests.
- `m2` (`resolve_in_artifact`): named `.standalone-install-incomplete` consistently.
- `m3` (`resolve_in_artifact`): added changed-file oxlint commands.
- `m4` (`resolve_in_artifact`): retained and explained the quick-mode `spec` ledger placeholder.

**Next:** Re-run the configured quick-start plan gate. Implementation may begin only after the plan review event reaches `passed`.

## Deviations from Plan / Design

Document any intentional deviations from the original plan, spec, or design. Include accepted review findings where the shipped implementation is source of truth and a lifecycle artifact needs alignment.

| Task / Review | Source Artifact | Planned / Documented | Actual / Accepted | Reason | Source of Truth | Follow-up |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------------- | --------- |
| -             | -               | -                    | -                 | -      | -               | -         |

## Test Results

Track test execution during implementation.

| Phase | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Coverage |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | -         | -      | -      | -        |
| 2     | -         | -      | -      | -        |
