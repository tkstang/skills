# Project State: cursor-collaboration-reliability

**Status:** Implementation In Progress
**Started:** 2026-07-17
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-22

## Current Phase

Implementation - Phase 2 blocked after terminal recovery review

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete; ready for `oat-project-design`)
- **Spec:** `spec.md` (complete; requirements formalized from discovery)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete; approved after review findings resolved)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete; approved after a passing artifact review)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (blocked at `p02-t03`; Phase 3 not started)

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery started
- ✓ Downstream lifecycle files scaffolded
- ✓ Requirements, alternatives, and boundaries documented
- ✓ Final cohesive scope confirmed
- ✓ Discovery complete
- ✓ Specification complete (folded into design)
- ✓ Full design draft authored
- ✓ Design artifact review received
- ✓ All seven review findings resolved directly in the design
- ✓ Design approved and complete
- ✓ Implementation plan authored: 6 sequential phases, 33 tasks
- ✓ Plan gate findings resolved directly in the artifact
- ✓ Operator-authorized plan gate passed with no findings
- ✓ Passing plan review received and archived
- ✓ Planning complete
- ✓ Implementation settings confirmed
- ✓ Phase 1 implementation complete
- ✓ Phase 1 root review passed after one bounded fix iteration
- ✓ Phase 2 implementation commits completed
- ✓ Two bounded Phase 2 review-fix iterations completed
- ✗ Final Phase 2 review retained 2 Important findings
- ✓ Operator authorized one additional bounded recovery cycle
- ✓ `origin/main` merged and integration gates passed at `aa35f45`
- ✓ Retained Phase 2 findings repaired at `471dd5e`
- ✗ Terminal recovery review retained 2 Important findings and 1 Medium finding
- ✗ Operator-authorized additional recovery cycle exhausted

## Blockers

- `p02-t01`: ancestor-component raw cwd aliases can still receive exact
  identity strength.
- `p02-t03`: a crash during contender-token publication can permanently wedge
  all three state-lock queues.
- Shipped recovery guidance remains stale for Cursor v2 reset and corruption.

## Next Milestone

Receive `reviews/p02-review-2026-07-23T114732Z.md`, decide whether to authorize
another bounded repair cycle, and resume with `oat-project-implement`.
