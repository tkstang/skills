# Project State: Consensus Review

**Status:** Planning complete and ready for `oat-project-implement`. The formal artifact review passed, the configured planning gate passed its Important threshold, and the user-approved finding dispositions are applied and recorded. Implementation has not started.
**Started:** 2026-09-16
**Baseline:** planning PR #84, `08f59459`; recheck main and PR #86 before implementation.
**Branch:** `feat/consensus-review`.

## Current Phase

Quick workflow, planning complete. User approved the smaller v1 and explicitly required interactive scope selection when omitted. All seven implementation tasks remain pending. No implementation, publication or global installation has started.

## Artifacts

- Discovery complete; revised decisions captured.
- Design is the behavioral source of truth: three selectors, skill-owned executable, external state, selected-file drift comparison, honest findings/provenance.
- Plan: seven tasks in three sequential phases. Original draft tasks are retired with a coverage map, not renumbered or marked complete. First active task is p06-t01.
- Implementation: not started; tracking reflects the revised task inventory.
- Spec: not used in quick mode.

## Review Posture

- High ceiling selected by the user; effective complete ladder was verified.
- Additional cross-runtime phase gates: disabled by user-approved complexity reduction; `oat_phase_review_gate` remains absent.
- Configured quick-start planning and implementation-final gates: keep. No lifecycle override map or global config edits. Unused lifecycle configurations remain untouched.
- Ordinary OAT phase/final reviews remain. Fable's receipt exercise is interoperability evidence, not an extra general review gate.
- The existing configured quick-start command is plan-only; execute unchanged and record `legacy-plan-only` scope when run. Formal plan review still checks consistency with design/discovery.
- Fable approved the revised scope and seven-task plan. Automatic formal artifact review passed without findings in the planning parent; provenance is recorded in plan.md.
- Configured planning gate run `128cf9b8-0007-4de1-a310-ec5383e43c90` passed the Important threshold (`status: ok`, `receiveEligible: true`, matched project/run/invocation). Scope was `legacy-plan-only`. Its consumed review is [artifact-plan-review-2026-09-17T000849Z.md](reviews/archived/artifact-plan-review-2026-09-17T000849Z.md). The user approved the six dispositions and continuation; implementation.md records each outcome. The gate event is `fixes_completed`, not a new clean re-review.

## Next Milestone

When the user authorizes execution, start `oat-project-implement` at p06-t01 in a separate visible Codex worktree. Carry this completed planning bundle into that worktree, recheck main and PR #86, and select implementation HiLL checkpoints at kickoff. No additional tasks or phases were added during receipt. Fable's next planned involvement remains the p08-t02 receipt exercise and normal cross-model review during implementation.

## Verification

Receipt validation passed `pnpm run validate`, `oat project validate-plan` and `git diff --check`. `oat project status` reports `quickPlanReadiness.ready: true`, seven tasks, zero completed, and p06-t01 next. Artifact assertions confirmed unchanged task IDs/counts, preserved review history, all six dispositions and a byte-identical archived review. PJM doctor reported declared adoption with all checks passing. The dashboard was refreshed locally. No product test or live provider acceptance is inferred from planning validation.

## Operational Notes

Use the verified current OAT binary at `/Users/tstang/Library/pnpm/bin/oat` on this machine. The scaffold's earlier path-scoped commit collided with a hook index lock; it cleared without deletion. Commit explicit staged paths with a normal non-path-scoped commit and preserve hooks. Generated dashboard remains local/ignored.

The planning gate's automatic project-log commit repeated that hook/index-lock failure on OAT 0.2.77. The root committed the exact log path with a normal staged commit, then replayed the supplied idempotent recovery command successfully. The CLI removed its transient recovery receipt. No lock was deleted or hook bypassed.
