# Project State: Consensus Review

**Status:** p07 review round 1 requested fixes for two Important and three Medium findings. All five are accepted for bounded fix iteration 1/2.
**Started:** 2026-09-16
**Baseline:** planning PR #84, `08f59459`; recheck main and PR #86 before implementation.
**Branch:** `feat/consensus-review`.

## Current Phase

Quick workflow, p06 accepted. p07 implementation is complete, but independent review found five in-scope contract gaps. All return to the original p07 implementer in bounded fix iteration 1/2. No publication, global installation, live provider acceptance or p08 work has completed.

## Artifacts

- Discovery complete; revised decisions captured.
- Design is the behavioral source of truth: three selectors, skill-owned executable, external state, selected-file drift comparison, honest findings/provenance.
- Plan: seven tasks in three sequential phases. Original draft tasks are retired with a coverage map, not renumbered or marked complete. First active task is p06-t01.
- Implementation: p06 task implementation committed at `f4fee75f` and `52b267c1`; bounded inventory recovery committed at `a1b2b427`; review fixes committed at `8a7871af`; current main integrated at `9cfe41ac`. Review round 2 passed at `ae059dfb` with zero findings and the full repository suite green.
- p07 implementation: scope/drift at `e40b46c2`, reviewer selection/config at `e75963bd`, and one-run validation/persistence at `a580a322`. Review round 1 at `4a83ce78` requested fixes for stale capture baselines, provenance honesty, unborn repositories, audit identities and output-failure diagnostics.
- Spec: not used in quick mode.

## Review Posture

- High ceiling selected by the user; effective complete ladder was verified.
- Additional cross-runtime phase gates: disabled by user-approved complexity reduction; `oat_phase_review_gate` remains absent.
- Configured quick-start planning and implementation-final gates: keep. No lifecycle override map or global config edits. Unused lifecycle configurations remain untouched.
- Ordinary OAT phase/final reviews remain. Fable's receipt exercise is interoperability evidence, not an extra general review gate.
- The existing configured quick-start command is plan-only; execute unchanged and record `legacy-plan-only` scope when run. Formal plan review still checks consistency with design/discovery.
- Fable approved the revised scope and seven-task plan. Automatic formal artifact review passed without findings in the planning parent; provenance is recorded in plan.md.
- Configured planning gate run `128cf9b8-0007-4de1-a310-ec5383e43c90` passed the Important threshold (`status: ok`, `receiveEligible: true`, matched project/run/invocation). Scope was `legacy-plan-only`. Its consumed review is [artifact-plan-review-2026-09-17T000849Z.md](reviews/archived/artifact-plan-review-2026-09-17T000849Z.md). The user approved the six dispositions and continuation; implementation.md records each outcome. The gate event is `fixes_completed`, not a new clean re-review.

## Next Milestone

Return all five accepted findings to the original p07 implementer in one append-only fix commit, verify, and re-review. The final-phase p08 HiLL checkpoint and automatic checkpoint review remain active.

## Verification

p07 review round 1 independently confirmed 69 focused tests and structural gates, then reproduced stale capture-to-baseline acceptance and unborn-repository rejection with no-provider probes. Verdict: changes requested with 0 Critical, 2 Important, 3 Medium and 0 Minor findings. Phase recovery remains unused; fix iteration 1/2 is next.

## Operational Notes

Use the verified current OAT binary at `/Users/tstang/Library/pnpm/bin/oat` on this machine. The scaffold's earlier path-scoped commit collided with a hook index lock; it cleared without deletion. Commit explicit staged paths with a normal non-path-scoped commit and preserve hooks. Generated dashboard remains local/ignored.

The planning gate's automatic project-log commit repeated that hook/index-lock failure on OAT 0.2.77. The root committed the exact log path with a normal staged commit, then replayed the supplied idempotent recovery command successfully. The CLI removed its transient recovery receipt. No lock was deleted or hook bypassed.
