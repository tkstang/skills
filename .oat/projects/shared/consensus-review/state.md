# Project State: Consensus Review

**Status:** p06 review round 1 requested fixes for two Important safety findings. Bounded fix iteration 1/2 is next; recovery remains settled at 1/10.
**Started:** 2026-09-16
**Baseline:** planning PR #84, `08f59459`; recheck main and PR #86 before implementation.
**Branch:** `feat/consensus-review`.

## Current Phase

Quick workflow, p06 task implementation and bounded recovery complete. Review round 1 found two Important safety defects; the original implementer will address them under bounded fix iteration 1/2. No publication, global installation, live provider acceptance or later phase has completed.

## Artifacts

- Discovery complete; revised decisions captured.
- Design is the behavioral source of truth: three selectors, skill-owned executable, external state, selected-file drift comparison, honest findings/provenance.
- Plan: seven tasks in three sequential phases. Original draft tasks are retired with a coverage map, not renumbered or marked complete. First active task is p06-t01.
- Implementation: p06 task implementation committed at `f4fee75f` and `52b267c1`; bounded inventory recovery committed at `a1b2b427`. Verification is accepted with one operator-approved non-p06 host-sensitive baseline; root review remains pending.
- Spec: not used in quick mode.

## Review Posture

- High ceiling selected by the user; effective complete ladder was verified.
- Additional cross-runtime phase gates: disabled by user-approved complexity reduction; `oat_phase_review_gate` remains absent.
- Configured quick-start planning and implementation-final gates: keep. No lifecycle override map or global config edits. Unused lifecycle configurations remain untouched.
- Ordinary OAT phase/final reviews remain. Fable's receipt exercise is interoperability evidence, not an extra general review gate.
- The existing configured quick-start command is plan-only; execute unchanged and record `legacy-plan-only` scope when run. Formal plan review still checks consistency with design/discovery.
- Fable approved the revised scope and seven-task plan. Automatic formal artifact review passed without findings in the planning parent; provenance is recorded in plan.md.
- Configured planning gate run `128cf9b8-0007-4de1-a310-ec5383e43c90` passed the Important threshold (`status: ok`, `receiveEligible: true`, matched project/run/invocation). Scope was `legacy-plan-only`. Its consumed review is [artifact-plan-review-2026-09-17T000849Z.md](reviews/archived/artifact-plan-review-2026-09-17T000849Z.md). The user approved the six dispositions and continuation; implementation.md records each outcome. The gate event is `fixes_completed`, not a new clean re-review.

## Next Milestone

Resume the original p06 implementer with only review findings I1 and I2, verify one bounded fix commit and full phase evidence, then run review round 2. The final-phase p08 HiLL checkpoint and automatic checkpoint review remain active.

## Verification

Both p06 task commits and recovery commit passed focused verification, build freshness, type-check and validation. Root independently reran the full suite: 2,074 passed, one skipped and only the operator-approved refine host-sensitive assertion failed (`claude,codex` versus `codex,claude`). The three p06 inventory assertions now pass. Recovery usage is settled at 1/10 with `pending_attempt: null`; root review has not run.

## Operational Notes

Use the verified current OAT binary at `/Users/tstang/Library/pnpm/bin/oat` on this machine. The scaffold's earlier path-scoped commit collided with a hook index lock; it cleared without deletion. Commit explicit staged paths with a normal non-path-scoped commit and preserve hooks. Generated dashboard remains local/ignored.

The planning gate's automatic project-log commit repeated that hook/index-lock failure on OAT 0.2.77. The root committed the exact log path with a normal staged commit, then replayed the supplied idempotent recovery command successfully. The CLI removed its transient recovery receipt. No lock was deleted or hook bypassed.
