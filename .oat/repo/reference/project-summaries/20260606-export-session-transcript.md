# Summary: export-session-transcript

## Overview

Coding-agent sessions hold useful conversation history, but there was no safe, consistent way to export the *current* session to a shareable file across runtimes. This project adds an `export-session-transcript` skill that writes the live conversation to a sanitized Markdown transcript — branch-named, default `~/Downloads` — for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor, while reusing (not duplicating) the cross-provider transcript knowledge that already existed in `session-observer`.

## What Was Implemented

- **`export-session-transcript` skill** (`skills/export-session-transcript/`): a CLI that selects the current session via an announced random-hex **session marker** (content-matched against the cwd's transcripts, newest-for-cwd fallback), then renders sanitized Markdown. Flags: `--match`, `--session`, `--all`, `--runtime`, `--out` (file or directory), `--cwd`. Output defaults to `~/Downloads/<branch>.md` (with a not-in-git fallback name). Selection-mode precedence is `--all` > `--session` > `--match` > default.
- **Two-layer sanitization** — the privacy boundary. Structural filtering (`normalizeEntries`, from the shared core: drops tool calls/results + command-messages) followed by an export-owned **content sanitizer** (`sanitize.mjs`) that drops injected/hidden payloads recorded as ordinary text: `<system-reminder>`, `<task-notification>`, `<local-command-*>`, `<environment_context>`, `<skill>…</skill>`, AGENTS.md/SKILL.md payloads, system/developer instructions, `<subagent_notification>`, `<turn_aborted>`. The session marker line is stripped from output.
- **Canonical shared core** (`shared/transcript-core/runtimes.mjs`): the per-provider transcript location/parsing primitives extracted as a single source of truth, materialized into each consuming skill's `scripts/lib/runtimes.mjs` via `npm run sync:transcript-core` (committed, banner-stamped copies) with a `--check` drift guard wired into `npm test`.
- **`session-observer` migrated** to consume the synced copy with no behavior change (body byte-identical to baseline).

## Key Decisions

- **Shared core + build-time sync over vendoring or hard dependency.** A single canonical module is synced into each skill so installed skills stay self-contained while there is one source of truth; a drift-guard test prevents the copies from diverging. Only `runtimes.mjs` is shared — observe-specific modules stay in `session-observer`.
- **Session marker for self-identification.** The running agent announces a unique marker that lands in its own transcript; the exporter greps for it to identify *this* conversation unambiguously (the inverse of `session-observer`'s peer model), with newest-for-cwd as a flush-lag fallback.
- **`normalizeEntries` is not the privacy boundary.** It only filters structural tool/command records; injected context arriving as plain user/assistant text (especially on Codex/Cursor) needs a dedicated content sanitizer. This was established by the design review and proven necessary by the implementation review.

## Notable Challenges

- **Privacy leaks were caught in review — twice, same class.** The first sanitizer relied too much on structural filtering and missed `<system-reminder>` (p02 review) — Claude Code's most common injected-context wrapper — which a reviewer confirmed leaked into the export against real transcripts. The fix made the matcher table evidence-driven (grepping real `~/.claude`/`~/.codex`/`~/.cursor` stores), adding matchers for `<system-reminder>`, `<task-notification>`, and `<local-command-*>`; a real-store scan over 1,411 files / 41,281 entries then showed zero leading-anchored survivors. A second final-review cycle then caught one more wrapper of the same class — `<skill>…</skill>` — fixed with a leading-anchored matcher (p03-t05). Lesson reinforced: the matcher table must be enumerated against real injected-wrapper forms, not just the obvious ones.

## Verification

- `npm test` (366 tests, integrated with `main`'s session-observer watch-mode work) · `npm run validate` · `npm run smoke` — all pass.
- Drift guard green; sanitizer real-store leak scan → 0 survivors.
- Reviews: design (artifact) passed; plan (artifact) passed; p01/p02/p03 phase reviews passed (p02 fail→fix→pass closing the `<system-reminder>` leak); final review cycle 1 passed (2 Minor → p03-t03/p03-t04); final review cycle 2 found I1 `<skill>` leak (Important) + M1 README drift → fixed in p03-t05/p03-t06 → re-review passed.

## Integration Notes

- Future per-provider transcript-format changes: edit `shared/transcript-core/runtimes.mjs` and run `npm run sync:transcript-core`; never hand-edit the generated `scripts/lib/runtimes.mjs` copies (drift-guarded). Documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- Adding a new runtime (e.g. Gemini): extend the canonical `runtimes.mjs` per its "Adding a New Runtime" notes, then re-sync; the export sanitizer matchers are content/role-based and largely runtime-agnostic.
- Follow-up: refresh `~/.agents/skills/session-observer` user-level install after this branch merges (the closeout sync was export-only to avoid globally installing pre-merge session-observer changes).
