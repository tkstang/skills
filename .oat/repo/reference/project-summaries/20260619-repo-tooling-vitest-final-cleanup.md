# Project Summary: repo-tooling-vitest-final-cleanup

## Overview

PR4 — the final cleanup of the repository's TypeScript/Vitest migration. Prior PRs moved runtime source and individual test suites onto canonical TypeScript + Vitest (consensus refine, transcript-core/export-session, and session-observer). This project removed the last vestiges of the legacy `node:test` runner: it converted the remaining repo/tooling `.test.mjs` suites to Vitest `.test.ts`, harmonized the session-observer suites onto Vitest `expect`, retired the `test:node` compatibility runner so `pnpm test` runs Vitest only, and added a guard that prevents the legacy runner from re-entering the repo. This completes backlog initiative **bl-bfb4**.

The work was purely developer tooling — shipped skills/plugins (which remain dependency-free and install-free per DR-002) were not touched, and all behavioral coverage was preserved 1:1.

## What Was Implemented

- **Converted 13 repo/tooling suites** from `node:test`/`node:assert/strict` `.test.mjs` to Vitest `.test.ts` (`describe`/`it`/`expect`), including `generated-output-sync` (dropping its special-case include from `vitest.config.mjs`). Subprocess spawns and `mkdtemp` fixtures preserved byte-for-byte.
- **Harmonized 9 session-observer suites** from `node:assert/strict` to Vitest `expect`, so the entire `tests/**` suite uses one assertion convention (PR3 had left them on `node:assert`).
- **Retired the `node:test` runner**: removed `test:node` from `package.json`; `pnpm test` now runs Vitest only (`node scripts/run-vitest.mjs`).
- **Added a guard** (`tests/tooling/no-node-test-runner.test.ts`) — a Vitest meta-test that fails if any `tests/**/*.test.mjs` reappears or any test source imports `node:test`/`node:assert`. Its fail-on-reintroduction behavior was independently verified by review.
- **Updated docs/reference** to the Vitest-only reality: `tests/AGENTS.md` (flipped from mixed-runner to single-runner), root `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `.oat/repo/reference/current-state.md`, `roadmap.md`, the backlog (bl-bfb4 → done), and completed history.

## Execution Shape

Quick-mode project, 4 phases / 12 tasks, sequential. Phase 1 was a hard gate that waited for PR3 (#17) to merge, then rebased onto `main` and re-catalogued the test tree before any edits — confirming assumptions against the merged implementation (one correction: PR3 had rewritten `tests/AGENTS.md`). Phases 2–4 executed Tier 1 (sonnet implementers, opus reviews); every phase passed its review on the first try (0 fix iterations).

## Verification

Full gate green: `build`, `type-check`, `build:check` (15/15 in sync), `test` (53 files / 572 tests under Vitest only), `validate`, `smoke`; scoped `oxlint`/`oxfmt --check` on changed files. Acceptance criteria confirmed mechanically: zero `.test.mjs`, zero actual `node:test`/`node:assert` imports in tests, no `test:node` in `package.json`. Final review (scope `final`, opus): PASS — 0 Critical / 0 Important.

## Decisions & Deviations

- **Assertion convention:** chose Vitest `expect` repo-wide (matches the 45-file dominant convention and the original brief), and brought session-observer harmonization into scope so the repo lands on one style rather than two.
- **Guard placement:** a Vitest meta-test under `tests/tooling/` (runs as part of `pnpm test`) rather than a `validate.mjs` check.
- **Two in-scope task-boundary deltas:** `tests/package-metadata.test.ts` (p03-t02) and `tests/docs-presence.test.ts` (p04-t01) were updated alongside the `package.json` / `tests/AGENTS.md` changes they assert — test-contract updates, coverage preserved.
- **Deferred (out of scope):** a future typed-API pass to remove the `as any` shims added during harmonization; recorded as optional long-tail polish, not a tracked item.

## Post-PR Notes

- **Final review re-run (v2):** an independent manual `final` code review re-verified the full branch (fresh `type-check`/`build:check`/`test`/`validate`/`smoke` + live guard probe) — 0 Critical / 0 Important. Its one Medium (M1) was stale lifecycle text in `plan.md`, resolved via artifact alignment (no code change).
- **CI fix:** the PR's `lint` job (oxfmt `--check` on changed files) flagged `vitest.config.mjs` — removing the special-case `include` entry shortened the array enough that oxfmt wants it inline. Reformatted (`style: oxfmt vitest.config.mjs`), pushed; PR #18 CI green (lint/commitlint/validate), merge state CLEAN.
